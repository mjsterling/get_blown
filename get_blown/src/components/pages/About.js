        <p>Conceived in a drafty garage on a fine Autumn day in Melbourne’s outer east, Get Blown Hairstyling has evolved from a passing idea in 2015 to a fully fledged and functional business.</p>
        <p>It’s no secret that the world is currently in a state of inexplicable uncertainty; Get Blown Hairstyling is a place where frivolity, laughter and self-care are not only fundamentally accessible for all; they are central themes of operation.</p>

        <p>Technical Colour Application </p>

        <p>Hollywood Blow Outs</p>
        <p>Fashion Colours</p>
        <p>Toning/Colour Correcting</p>
        <p>Hair Ups/Formal Styling</p>
        <p>and everything in between.</p>
        
        <p>Let us act as your conduit en route to artistic expression; consult and establish your expectations and achieve them through our obsession with results.</p>
